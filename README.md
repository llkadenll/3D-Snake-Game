# 3D Snake Game
## Description:
3D representation using OpenGL of the popular Snake game.<br>During the implementation, 8 textured models were used, two light sources and shading were introduced.<br>
For better entertainment, we have added obstacles that the snake must avoid and a double-scored golden apple that makes the game more difficult, in the form of snake acceleration.<br>
The project was co-created with Jakub Garus.<br>
